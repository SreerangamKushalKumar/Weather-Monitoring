# Weather-Monitoring
Develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system will utilize data from the OpenWeatherMap API 
# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

## Overview
The **Real-Time Weather Monitoring System** is a dynamic, data-driven application that monitors weather conditions in real-time, aggregates the data, and provides daily weather summaries. The system uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch weather data for major metros in India and allows users to configure alert thresholds. The system processes this data to generate insights such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, as well as dominant weather conditions for the day.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Continuously retrieves and processes weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at configurable intervals.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Converts temperature data from Kelvin to Celsius or Fahrenheit based on user preferences.
- **Daily Weather Summary**: Aggregates daily weather data, including average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather conditions.
- **Alerting System**: Configurable thresholds for triggering alerts when certain weather conditions (e.g., temperature exceeding 35°C) are met.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays weather summaries, historical trends, and triggered alerts through visual charts (optional).
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to support additional weather parameters such as humidity, wind speed, and weather forecasts.

## Data Source
The system uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to gather weather data. The following weather parameters are processed:
- **Main Weather Condition**: (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
- **Temperature**: Current temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- **Feels Like**: Perceived temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- **Timestamp**: Unix timestamp of the weather update

## Processing and Analysis
- **API Calls**: The system makes API calls at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) to gather weather data for cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Converts Kelvin to Celsius or Fahrenheit based on user settings.

### Rollups and Aggregates
1. **Daily Weather Summary**:
   - Roll up the weather data for each day and store it in a persistent database.
   - Calculate daily aggregates for:
     - **Average Temperature**
     - **Maximum Temperature**
     - **Minimum Temperature**
     - **Dominant Weather Condition** (based on the most frequent weather condition throughout the day)

2. **Alerting Thresholds**:
   - Users can set custom thresholds, such as triggering an alert if the temperature exceeds a specified value (e.g., 35°C) for two consecutive updates.
   - Alerts are either displayed on the console or sent via email (configurable).

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize weather summaries and triggered alerts using charts and graphs (optional).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (for running the application locally)
- **MongoDB** or any other database for storing daily weather summaries
- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Sign up for a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-monitoring-system.git
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
cd weather-monitoring-system
npm install
Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following details:

bash
Copy code
API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
INTERVAL=300000 # (5 minutes in milliseconds)
Run the Application: Start the system using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Docker Setup (Optional)
If you'd like to containerize the application, you can use Docker:

Build the Docker Image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t weather-monitoring-system .
Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 weather-monitoring-system
Database Setup
For the daily summaries, you can use MongoDB or any relational database. Make sure to configure the connection string in your .env file.

Usage
Real-Time Monitoring:

The system will automatically fetch and process weather data every 5 minutes (or as per your configuration).
Daily Summaries:

The system will aggregate daily weather data and store the summary in the database.
Alert Configuration:

Set alert thresholds (e.g., max temperature) in the application, and the system will notify when the thresholds are breached.
Test Cases
System Setup:

Test that the system connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key.
Data Retrieval:

Simulate API calls and ensure the system retrieves and parses weather data correctly.
Temperature Conversion:

Verify the conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit).
Daily Weather Summary:

Simulate multiple days of weather updates and validate that the system calculates correct daily summaries.
Alerting System:

Configure thresholds and simulate data that breaches them to ensure alerts are triggered.
Bonus Features
Support for additional weather parameters (e.g., humidity, wind speed).
Integration of weather forecast data.
Enhanced visualizations for weather trends and history.
Project Dependencies
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
MongoDB: (Optional) Database for storing daily weather summaries.
OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching real-time weather data.
Docker: (Optional) For containerizing the application.
