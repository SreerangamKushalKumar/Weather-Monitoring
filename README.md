# Overview
The Real-Time Weather Monitoring System uses the OpenWeatherMap API to continuously track weather conditions, providing real-time data on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Users can switch between Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin for temperature display. The system generates daily weather summaries, including average, minimum, and maximum temperatures, and visualizes a 5-day forecast through an intuitive 5-shade section. It also triggers alerts for extreme weather conditions based on user-defined thresholds.
